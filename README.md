# Authorizenet_CIM_gateway
PMPro payment gateway for Authorize.net Customer Information Manager (CIM)

This plugin modifies PMPro to add Authorize.net CIM as a gateway option.

It allows for the creation of a Customer profile for each member, as well as payment profiles that store the customer's billing information in Authorize.net's secure system.

This allows for returning customers to easily make purchases without needing to manually re-enter the credit card and billing information.

Works in conjunction with another plugin I created that allows each member to have multiple memberships inside PMPro.
